# cinema-app
This application is a cinema service, where users can register and use the shopping cart to add tickets.
There are also different cinema halls, films and movie sessions with different times and dates.

In terms of roles and permissions, the application would support two main roles: admin and user. As the admin,
you would have full access to the application and its features, including the ability to create cinemahalls,
movie sessions, and add movies to the database. Users, on the other hand, would be able to add tickets to their
shopping cart and create orders, but would not have access to the administrative features of the application.
